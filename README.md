### Project Operation

1. This program begins by prompting the user for the cost of their product.

2. The program then prompts the user for the money intended to cover the cost.

3. The program evaluates whether the payment is sufficient to cover the cost and responds to the customer accordingly, either asking for proper payment if the payment is insufficient or thanking them for using exact change.

4. In the event that the payment exceeds the cost of the product, it dispenses the appropriate change in the fewest bills/coins possible. It displays the change in both numeric dollar format (e.g $1.20) and in currency denomination format (e.g. 1 one dollar bill, 2 dimes).

5. The program then thanks the customer for his or her business.

### Lessons Learned

 - Doubles sometimes have difficulty with certain numbers which it might interpret as repeating decimal numbers. These numbers tend to be derived from fractions that form odd decimaled numbers such as 1/3 or 2/3 (0.3333333334 and 0.6666666667 respectively)
 
 - Dividing the workload of your class into different methods makes your code look cleaner and more efficient.
