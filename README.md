### Project Operation

1. This program begins by prompting the user for the cost of their product.

2. The program then prompts the user for the money intended to cover the cost.

3. The program evaluates whether the payment is sufficient to cover the cost and responds to the customer accordingly, either asking for proper payment if the payment is insufficient or thanking them for using exact change.

4. In the event that the payment exceeds the cost of the product, it dispenses the appropriate change in the fewest bills/coins possible.
